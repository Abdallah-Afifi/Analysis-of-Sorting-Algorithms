The provided code implements the Heap Sort algorithm, which is a comparison-based sorting algorithm that utilizes the heap data structure. Let's go through the code step by step to understand its functionality.

First, we have the header file "HeapSort.h" that includes the necessary dependencies and defines the class `HeapSort`. It also includes the header file "SortingAlgorithm.h". The `HeapSort` class is derived from the `SortingAlgorithm` class.

The `HeapSort` class has the following member functions:
1. `HeapSort()`: This is the constructor for the `HeapSort` class. It initializes the `SortingAlgorithm` base class with the name "Heap Sort".
2. `void Sort(std::vector<int>& vec)`: This function performs the heap sort algorithm on the input vector `vec`. It sorts the elements in ascending order.
3. `void Model(int size)`: This function calculates a model value based on the size of the input. It computes `(size * std::log2(size))` and stores the result in the `model` member variable.

Next, we have the implementation file "HeapSort.cpp". It includes the header files "HeapSort.h" and "SortingAlgorithm.h". It also includes additional dependencies such as `<vector>`, `<algorithm>`, `<string>`, and `<cmath>`.

Inside the "HeapSort.cpp" file, the constructor `HeapSort::HeapSort()` is defined. It calls the constructor of the base class `SortingAlgorithm` and passes the string "Heap Sort" as the name.

The `HeapSort::Model(int size)` function is also defined in this file. It calculates a model value by multiplying the `size` parameter by the logarithm (base 2) of the size using `std::log2`. The result is stored in the `model` member variable.

The `HeapSort::Sort(std::vector<int>& vec)` function is where the heap sort algorithm is implemented. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. Initialize the variable `size` to the size of the input vector `vec`.
2. Build a max heap from the input vector by calling the `BuildMaxHeap` function.
3. Starting from the end of the vector, swap the root element (maximum element) with the current element, reduce the size of the heap by one, and call the `Heapify` function to restore the max heap property.
4. Repeat step 3 until all elements are sorted in ascending order.

The `HeapSort::BuildMaxHeap(std::vector<int>& vec, int size)` function is responsible for building a max heap from the input vector. It starts from the last non-leaf node (size / 2 - 1) and calls the `Heapify` function to ensure that the subtree rooted at each node satisfies the max heap property.

The `HeapSort::Heapify(std::vector<int>& vec, int i, int size)` function is used to maintain the max heap property in the heap. It takes an index `i` and compares the element at index `i` with its left and right child nodes. If any of the child nodes are larger, it swaps the element with the largest child and recursively calls `Heapify` on the affected subtree.

During the sorting process, the `comparisons` and `swaps` member variables are updated to keep track of the number of comparisons and swaps performed.

Overall, this code provides an implementation of the Heap Sort algorithm, which leverages the properties of the heap data structure to efficiently sort the elements in an array or vector.
