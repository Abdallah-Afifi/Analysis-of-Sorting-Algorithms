The code implements the Selection Sort algorithm using the `SelectionSort` class. Let's go through each part of the code:

1. The header file "SelectionSort.h" defines the `SelectionSort` class, which is derived from the `SortingAlgorithm` class. It declares two member functions: `Sort` and `Model`. The class includes the necessary header files.

2. The `SelectionSort` function is the constructor of the `SelectionSort` class. It initializes the base class `SortingAlgorithm` with the name "Selection Sort".

3. The `Model` function is used to calculate the model for the given input size. In this case, it sets the `model` member variable of the base class `SortingAlgorithm` to the square of the input size (`std::pow(size, 2)`). The model represents the expected time complexity of the sorting algorithm.

4. The `Sort` function implements the Selection Sort algorithm to sort the input vector `vec` in ascending order. It first determines the size of the vector. The outer loop iterates from the beginning of the vector (`i = 0`) to the second-to-last element (`i < size - 1`). It selects the current element as the minimum element (`minIdx = i`).

5. The inner loop iterates from the next element after the current element (`j = i + 1`) to the end of the vector (`j < size`). It compares each element with the current minimum element (`vec[j] < vec[minIdx]`). If a smaller element is found, it updates the minimum index (`minIdx = j`). The `comparisons` counter is incremented to keep track of the number of comparisons made during the sorting process.

6. After finding the minimum element in the remaining unsorted portion of the vector, it swaps the minimum element with the current element (`std::swap(vec[i], vec[minIdx])`). The `swaps` counter is incremented to keep track of the number of swaps made during the sorting process.

7. The process continues until the entire vector is sorted in ascending order.

The `SelectionSort` class provides an implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm, which repeatedly selects the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the vector and places it at the beginning. The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the average and worst case, where n is the size of the input vector.
