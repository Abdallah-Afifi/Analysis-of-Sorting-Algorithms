The provided code represents an implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm. Let's go through the code to understand its functionality.

First, we have the header file "InsertionSort.h" that includes the necessary dependencies and defines the class `InsertionSort`. It includes the header file "SortingAlgorithm.h". The `InsertionSort` class is derived from the `SortingAlgorithm` class.

The `InsertionSort` class has the following member functions:
1. `InsertionSort()`: This is the constructor for the `InsertionSort` class. It initializes the `SortingAlgorithm` base class with the name "Insertion Sort".
2. `void Sort(std::vector<int>& vec)`: This function performs the insertion sort algorithm on the input vector `vec`. It sorts the elements in ascending order.
3. `void Model(int size)`: This function calculates a model value based on the size of the input. It computes `(size * size)` using the `std::pow` function and stores the result in the `model` member variable.

Next, we have the implementation file "InsertionSort.cpp". It includes the header files "InsertionSort.h" and "SortingAlgorithm.h". It also includes additional dependencies such as `<vector>`, `<string>`, and `<cmath>`.

Inside the "InsertionSort.cpp" file, the constructor `InsertionSort::InsertionSort()` is defined. It calls the constructor of the base class `SortingAlgorithm` and passes the string "Insertion Sort" as the name.

The `InsertionSort::Model(int size)` function is also defined in this file. It calculates a model value by computing `size` raised to the power of 2 using the `std::pow` function. The result is stored in the `model` member variable.

The `InsertionSort::Sort(std::vector<int>& vec)` function is where the insertion sort algorithm is implemented. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. Initialize the variable `size` to the size of the input vector `vec`.
2. Iterate over the vector from index 1 to `size - 1` (inclusive).
3. For each iteration, store the current element (`vec[i]`) in the variable `key`.
4. Initialize a variable `j` to `i - 1`.
5. While `j` is greater than or equal to 0 and the element at `vec[j]` is greater than `key`, shift the elements to the right by assigning `vec[j]` to `vec[j + 1]`. Decrement `j` by 1.
6. Inside the while loop, update the `comparisons` and `swaps` variables to keep track of the number of comparisons and swaps made.
7. Assign `key` to its correct position in the sorted part of the vector by assigning it to `vec[j + 1]`.
8. Repeat steps 3-7 until all elements are sorted.

During the sorting process, the `comparisons` and `swaps` member variables are updated to keep track of the number of comparisons and swaps performed.

Overall, this code provides an implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm, which iterates over the elements of an array or vector and inserts each element into its correct position within the sorted subarray.
