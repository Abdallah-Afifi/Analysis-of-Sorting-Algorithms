The code implements the `TreeSort` class, which is a sorting algorithm based on the concept of binary search trees. Let's go through each part of the code:

1. The header file "TreeSort.h" declares the `TreeSort` class and includes the necessary header files.

2. The `TreeSort` class inherits from the `SortingAlgorithm` class.

3. Within the `TreeSort` class, there is a private nested structure called `Node`, which represents a node in the binary search tree. Each `Node` has an integer value, and pointers to its left and right children.

4. The `TreeSort` class has a default constructor `TreeSort()` and overrides the `Sort` and `Model` functions inherited from the `SortingAlgorithm` class.

5. The `Model` function calculates the expected time complexity of the sorting algorithm based on the input size. In this case, it uses the formula `size * log2(size)`.

6. The `Sort` function is responsible for sorting the vector using the tree sort algorithm. It creates an empty root node (`Node* root = nullptr`), and iterates over each element in the input vector.

7. Inside the loop, the `Insert` function is called to insert each element into the binary search tree. The `Insert` function recursively inserts the element into the appropriate position in the tree based on its value.

8. After all the elements are inserted into the tree, the input vector is cleared (`vec.clear()`) to prepare for storing the sorted values.

9. The `TraverseInOrder` function is called to perform an in-order traversal of the binary search tree. This traversal visits the left subtree, processes the current node, and then visits the right subtree.

10. During the in-order traversal, if the vector is not empty and the value of the current node is smaller than the last value in the vector, a swap operation is performed to maintain the sorted order. The number of swaps is incremented.

11. The value of the current node is then added to the vector (`vec.push_back(root->value)`).

12. Finally, the `TraverseInOrder` function is called recursively for the right subtree.

13. The `Insert` and `TraverseInOrder` functions are private member functions of the `TreeSort` class and are used internally for the sorting process.

The `TreeSort` class implements the tree sort algorithm by constructing a binary search tree from the input vector and then performing an in-order traversal to retrieve the sorted values. The algorithm has an expected time complexity of `O(n log n)`, making it suitable for sorting moderately sized data sets efficiently.
