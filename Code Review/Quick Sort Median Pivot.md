The code represents the implementation of the Quick Sort algorithm with the median-of-three pivot selection strategy. Let's go through each part of the code:

1. The header file "QuickSortMedianPivot.h" defines the class `QuickSortMedianPivot`, which is derived from the base class `SortingAlgorithm`. It declares the constructor, `Sort` function, and `Model` function. Additionally, it declares the private functions `QuickSortHelper`, `MedianOfThree`, and `Partition`.

2. The constructor `QuickSortMedianPivot::QuickSortMedianPivot()` initializes the `SortingAlgorithm` base class with the name "Quick Sort Median Pivot".

3. The `Model` function calculates and sets the expected number of operations (`model`) for sorting an array of size `size` using the Quick Sort algorithm with the median-of-three pivot selection strategy. In this case, the expected number of operations is based on the size of the array multiplied by the logarithm of the size.

4. The `Sort` function is the entry point for sorting an input vector. It calls the `QuickSortHelper` function to perform the actual sorting.

5. The `QuickSortHelper` function is a recursive helper function that implements the Quick Sort algorithm with the median-of-three pivot selection. It takes the input vector, the left and right indices of the subarray being processed. It selects a pivot element using the `MedianOfThree` function, partitions the subarray based on the pivot, and recursively calls itself on the left and right partitions.

6. The `MedianOfThree` function is responsible for selecting the pivot element using the median-of-three strategy. It takes the input vector, the left and right indices of the subarray. It compares the values at the left, mid, and right indices, and swaps the elements to ensure that the pivot value is in the middle position. The function returns the index of the pivot element.

7. The `Partition` function is similar to the one in the QuickSortFirstPivot implementation. It partitions the subarray based on the pivot element, which is obtained from the `MedianOfThree` function. The function swaps elements to move elements smaller than the pivot to the left of the `storeIndex`. Finally, it moves the pivot to its correct position and returns the `storeIndex`.

The Quick Sort algorithm with the median-of-three pivot selection strategy improves the performance in certain cases, especially when the input array is partially sorted or has a few elements that are already in their correct positions. By selecting the pivot as the median of three elements (left, mid, and right), it aims to choose a pivot that is closer to the true median of the subarray. This strategy helps to reduce the chances of worst-case behavior and improve the efficiency of the algorithm in practice.
