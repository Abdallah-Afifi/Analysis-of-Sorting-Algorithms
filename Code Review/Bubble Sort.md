The given code represents an implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm, which is a simple sorting algorithm. Let's break down the code and understand it step by step.

First, we have the header file "BubbleSort.h" that includes the necessary dependencies and defines the class `BubbleSort`. It also includes the header file "SortingAlgorithm.h". The `BubbleSort` class is derived from the `SortingAlgorithm` class.

The `BubbleSort` class has the following member functions:
1. `BubbleSort()`: This is the constructor for the `BubbleSort` class. It initializes the `SortingAlgorithm` base class with the name "Bubble Sort".
2. `void Sort(std::vector<int>& vec)`: This function performs the bubble sort algorithm on the input vector `vec`. It sorts the elements in ascending order.
3. `void Model(int size)`: This function calculates a model value based on the size of the input. It uses the `std::pow` function from the `<cmath>` library to compute the square of the size.

Next, we have the implementation file "BubbleSort.cpp". It includes the header files "BubbleSort.h" and "SortingAlgorithm.h". It also includes additional dependencies such as `<vector>`, `<string>`, and `<cmath>`.

Inside the "BubbleSort.cpp" file, the constructor `BubbleSort::BubbleSort()` is defined. It calls the constructor of the base class `SortingAlgorithm` and passes the string "Bubble Sort" as the name.

The `BubbleSort::Model(int size)` function is also defined in this file. It calculates a model value by raising the `size` parameter to the power of 2 using `std::pow`. The result is stored in the `model` member variable.

Finally, the `BubbleSort::Sort(std::vector<int>& vec)` function is implemented. It takes a reference to a vector of integers (`vec`) as input and performs the bubble sort algorithm on it. The algorithm iterates over the vector multiple times, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The `comparisons` and `swaps` member variables are updated during the sorting process to keep track of the number of comparisons and swaps performed.

Overall, this code provides an implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm and a few additional functions specific to the `BubbleSort` class.
