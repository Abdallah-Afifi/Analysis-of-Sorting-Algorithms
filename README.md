# Analysis-of-Sorting-Algorithms

Define the project requirements: Read and understand the project requirements, the sorting algorithms that need to be implemented, and the method of verification.

Design the system: Develop a plan for the software system. This includes designing the architecture, creating the UML diagrams, and creating class structure and header files.

Generate Random Permutation Arrays (RPA): Implement a function to generate RPA for the first N integers in the array. This should ensure that all integers from 1 to N are present but in a random order, with no integer missing and no integer duplicated.

Implement Sorting Algorithms: Implement the selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort with the first element as the pivot, and randomized quick sort. Add counters to each algorithm to count the number of element comparisons.

Count the Number of Array Element Comparisons: Introduce a counter inside the code to count the number of array element comparisons done by the algorithm at the end of the sorting process.

Conduct Experiments: Conduct 6 different experiments, using 6 different array sizes (N = 1000, 2000, 3000, 5000, 7000, 10000), for each of the 5 sorting algorithms. For each experiment, find Texp(N) (the number of array element comparisons that you counted as done by the algorithm for each of the 6 array sizes N).

Compare Experimental and Expected Results: Compare the experimental results with those expected Tmodel(N) from the mathematical modeling of the algorithm. Show the comparison in tables and graphical form.

Analyze the Results: Provide an analysis of the results in comparison with those expected from the mathematical modeling of the algorithms. Use Tmodel(N) for the tested algorithms, given in Appendix 3.

Develop the Final Report: Develop the final report of the project in the format provided. Include all UML diagrams, class structure and class header files, source code, and a small readme with your names, IDs, and sections you are registered in.
