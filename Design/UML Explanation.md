SortingAlgorithm and SelectionSort: Inheritance (SortingAlgorithm is the base class and SelectionSort is the derived class).
SortingAlgorithm and SortTester: Association (SortTester uses SortingAlgorithm objects as a parameter in its TestSortingAlgorithm() method).
RandomPermutationVectorGenerator and SortTester: Association (SortTester uses RandomPermutationVectorGenerator objects to generate test vectors for sorting algorithms).
SelectionSort and SortTester: Association (SortTester uses SelectionSort objects as a parameter in its TestSortingAlgorithm() method).
As for multiplicity, there is a one-to-many relationship between SortTester and SortingAlgorithm, as TestSortingAlgorithm() takes a single SortingAlgorithm object as a parameter and tests it with multiple vectors of different sizes. However, there is a one-to-one relationship between SortTester and the other classes.

There is no multiplicity relationship between SortingAlgorithm and SelectionSort, as there is only one SelectionSort object created in the main() function.

There is no multiplicity relationship between RandomPermutationVectorGenerator and SortTester, as a single RandomPermutationVectorGenerator object is used to generate test vectors for all sorting algorithms.
